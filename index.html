                 <h3>Here's a time line of Abdul Sattar Edhi's life </h3>
      <p>Edhi, born in pre-partition India in 1928, migrated to Pakistan in 1947. Although he was nearly broke, he immediately began helping others and was devoted to assisting the poor. He established the Edhi Foundation in 1951. The Edhi foundation, located in Karachi, Pakistan, is an establishment of social services for the destitute, including: nursing homes, orphanages, soup kitchens, maternity wards, women's shelters, rehabilitation centers, as well as the largest voluntary ambulance fleet in the world ("Statement by NSC..."). The Edhi Foundation has rescued and supported hundreds of thousands of people in need, including the thousands of children that Edhi himself had legal guardianship of (Sommerlad). </p>
      
      <p>Despite the challenges that arose from the opposition of the religious community, Edhi demonstrated selfless and devoted characteristics at every opportunity. Abdul Sattar Edhi, often known as the <em> "Angel of Mercy,"  </em> lived up to his name as he placed the destitute of Karachi, Pakistan before himself, and pledged to be devoted to them till his dying breath.</p>
      
      <p> Abdul Sattar Edhi once said, <em>"People have become educated... but have yet to become human (Sommerlad)." </em>  Abdul Sattar Edhi was not only a human, but an extraordinary person who exemplified society's desirable traits. </p>
